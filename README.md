## self-introduction 
Good morning, my admirable professors and my dear fellows. It’s my great honor to be here to introduce myself to all of you. My name is jiang shi jie and I’m in my twenty-three years old. I come fromYunNan, which is a famous and beautiful province. I strongly suggest you visiting there and I can be your guide if it’s convenient.I am outgoing and I have many interests, such as playing table ball, football, but I am only good at table ball. I hope we can always play together in the next three years. Computer Science and Technology is my favorite subject and I am sure that it's also a promising area in the future, with the great development of computer science and our society. I am glad to be a classmate of you and I hope we can study and make progress together in the future. I greatly expect my life to be with you in the coming future years.
